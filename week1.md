During the first week, I met with my research team: Kayla, Grace, Maya (Graduate Mentor), & Dr. Meeker (Faculty Advisor). We learned a little about each other and reviewed what we would do for our project. I met a lot of faculty advisors/researchers and research assistants who are a part of the institute. I also completed multiple workshops and info sessions with the cohort. We completed some coding activities and learned some info about Python. I also did an icebreaker with my research team by building a tower out of pasta. Our structure fell, but it was an interesting experience. We also played games like Kahoot, Jeopardy, and Headbandz.
