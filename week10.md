This week ws the final week of the intership! My group counducted our last statistcal analyses for our findings and prepared our presentation for the End of Summer symposium. On presentation day, our group went first and we did amazing!
It was nice to see othe other group's presentations and see how far we all have come in this institute. We have gained so much knowledge and experience over these last 10 weeks and I am very grateful to have been a part of this 
experience. Wednesday was our offical last day. My group finished our paper, received our certificates, and said our goodbye's :( 
Overall this has been a interesting, informative, knowledgeable, fun, tiring, and challenging experience and I'm glad I was chosen for this internship!
