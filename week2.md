We had our first writing workshop with Prof Pandey. During that workshop, Prof Pandey talked about an array of topics. SHe talked about what writing is, how to write a paper, the outline 
of a paper, and how to organize a paper. We breifly talked about credibility and how to know if a peer reviewed source is reliable. She emphazied the importance of writing throughout the
research process and how they coincide with each other. 

After the workshop, I met with my research lab. We bagan to look at our dataset and start looking at some similarities between the particpants and generate some research ideas.
