## Week 2

**June 3, 2024**

We had our first writing workshop with Prof Pandey. During that workshop, Prof Pandey talked about an array of topics. SHe talked about what writing is, how to write a paper, the outline 
of a paper, and how to organize a paper. We breifly talked about credibility and how to know if a peer reviewed source is reliable. She emphazied the importance of writing throughout the
research process and how they coincide with each other. 

After the workshop, I met with my research lab. We bagan to look at our dataset and start looking at some similarities between the particpants and generate some research ideas.

Our group began taking one of our ideas and turning it into a research question. 

We looked at how marital satisfaction has changed over time (pre-COVID, during COVId, post-COVID). We looked at data from 2019 and 2021 and noticed a slight decline in marriage rate and 
divorce rate. We then deveoped a broad question: Were marroed people ewxperiencing less severe mental health symptoms compared to single people? We looked at our data set and made note 
of the marital status of the participants: Never Married (368), Married (182), Living as Married (38), Divorced (83), Seperated (15), Widowed (11), Refused to Answer (4). We then needed 
to define "single" and "married." For this study, single people would be, Never Married and Widowed. "Married" would include Married and Living as Married. And we still were trying to 
decide where Divorced and Seperated would be categorized. The mental health symptoms we wanted to focus on were stress, anxiety, and depression. 

We refined our question to be: During COVID-19, did marital status impact stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, among adults in the U.S.? Our hypothesis was that single people would 
self report higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, compared to married people. And within the single population, individuals that self report higher levels of stress will 
also report heightened anxiety and depression symptoms.

We analyzed our next topic on COVID-19 and Substance Use. 

We gathered stats about drug overdose deaths from 2018-2023. We noted that there was a decline in overdoses in 2023 compared to 2022 (the first decline since 2018, according to the CDC). During COVID-19, 50% of people suffering from Substance Use Disorder experienced mental illness symptoms and drug overdoes rose by 50%. 

These are the following Risk Factors we identified:
- Lack of resources for people of color
- Social Isolation
- Economic Burden
- Limited access to treatment
- Regulatory barriers to telehealth
- Stress
- Existing health disparities (among underserved communities)

We developed the following research questions: To what extent did stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic influence an increased use of substances in adults in the U.S.?
Our population was substance users - we also needed to define and understand the difference between substance use and substance abuse. After doing so, we decided to use substance use for this study. 

Our grad mentor, Maya, helped us connect the Machine Learning ascpect to this study. We would use machine learning to create a predictive algorithm to classify relevant risk factors that lead to the outcome of COVID-19 related stress among sybstance users.
