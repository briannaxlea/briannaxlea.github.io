We had the writing workshop for the first half of the day. Dr. Pandey reviewed the information we talked about last week. Today we talked about the abstarct portion of technical papers. She had us look up an article related to our topic and read the abtract. 

We had a lab meeting with Dr. Meeker. We updated him on the status of our project. We also proposed our revised research question and hypothesis, which he approved of. We also wrote out our project summary paragraph, which includes our ojectives, hypothesis, research question, and prediction.
