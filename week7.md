This week we continued running some statistical analyses. We also made some revisions to our presentation and practiced for the Mid Summer Presentation. 
Our group was the first to go. At first, there were some technical difficulties, but we got through them. It wasn't as nerve wracking as I thought it would be. And we received some good feedback about our presentation. It was nice to see all the other projects of our institute and seeing all the things poeple are working on. 

We took the articles from our lit reviews and began writing summaries for them. We assigned our roles for the technical paper and had a short writing workshop meet with Dr Pandey. We completed our weekly report video and started planning what we are doing for the next 2 weeks.
